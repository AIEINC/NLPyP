NLPyP – Neuro-Semantic Summarizer

A Python-powered Flask web application that leverages advanced NLP techniques to deliver concise, emotion-enhanced semantic summaries of input text.


---

Overview

This program uses modern NLP technologies, including SpaCy, NLTK, Transformers, and Sentence-Transformers, to create intelligent semantic summaries. Summaries are emotionally enhanced based on a selectable emotional tone, simplifying complex text into two user-friendly tiers for quick insight.


---

Features

Semantic Text Summarization using transformers (BART-large-CNN).

Emotion-based Highlighting (joy, fear, sadness, trust, anticipation).

Readable summaries presented in two tiers:

Tier 1: Short, concise summary (20 words).

Tier 2: Detailed summary (100 words).


Mobile-compatible web interface with responsive HTMX interaction.



---

Technology Stack

Python (Flask, SpaCy, NLTK, Transformers, Sentence-Transformers, PyTorch)

HTMX (interactive AJAX-like user interface)

HTML/CSS (responsive frontend)
